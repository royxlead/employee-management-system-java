# Employee Management System (Java)

A desktop application built in **Java Swing** for managing employee records, seamlessly integrated with **MySQL**. This project exemplifies full-stack essentials: a graphical front-end, back-end database operations, and real-world functionality. ([GitHub][1])

## Features

* **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, delete, and view employee information with ease. ([GitHub][1])
* **MySQL Database Integration**: Stores all employee details persistently using MySQL. ([GitHub][1])
* **Interactive GUI**: Developed with Java Swing for intuitive, user-friendly interaction. ([GitHub][1])
* **Date-Picker Support**: Includes JCalendar integration for easy date selection (e.g. joining dates). ([GitHub][1])
* **Input Validation**: Ensures data integrity by validating user inputs before database transactions. ([GitHub][1])

| Component     | Details                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**  | Java                                              |
| **Database**  | MySQL                                             |
| **Libraries** | `mysql-connector-java`, `jcalendar` ([GitHub][1]) |

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/royxlead/employee-management-system-java.git
   cd employee-management-system-java
   ```

2. **Import into your IDE**

   * Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or your preferred Java IDE.
   * Ensure that included JARs (`mysql-connector-java` and `jcalendar`) are added to your classpath. ([GitHub][1])

3. **Configure the Database**

   * Create a MySQL database, e.g., `ems_db`.
   * Import the provided SQL schema (if any). ([GitHub][1])

4. **Run the Application**

   * Either run via IDE, or:

     ```bash
     java -jar employee_management_system.jar
     ```
   * The application GUI should launch for use.

## Potential Enhancements

* Implement **user authentication** with role-based access control (admin, manager, etc.).
* Add **reporting features**, like PDF or Excel exports of employee data.
* Enable **cloud database support** for remote access and scalability.
* Modernize the UI using **JavaFX** for improved aesthetics and performance.
* Incorporate **search, sorting, and filtering** within the GUI for better usability.
